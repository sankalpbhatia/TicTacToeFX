I have tried to create an Artificially Intelligent TicTacToe game player using the popular [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm.
The heart of the code is a function which calculates the best possible move for the computer to make. 

Although it seemed trivial at first, it was humbling to write it down properly. I have used Java-FX to provide the UI.

Any suggestions for the UI and the game code are most welcome :)
